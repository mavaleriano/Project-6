# Project-6
 Static Node.js and Express Site

 Changes from original--
 1) Changed font color for 'My Porfolio' (on style.css)
 2) Added random images for 404 Error (error.pug)
 3) Changed background color (style.css)

 Rather than use a /projects url, I simply have it so /# (1-5) will take you to the appropriate project
