        | This portfolio is itself the fruit of my endevour to become a Full Stack Developer. It's a visual representation of the result of that newfound knowledge and a window into all the other previous projects that I have been working on in the past few months through TeamTreehouse. This porfolio, as a project, is a web application created through the combination of Node.js and Express where I'm able to link up all those other projects as well as my personal social media.
